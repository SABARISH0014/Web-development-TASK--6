# Web-development-TASK--6

Description: Develop a simple image gallery
application that displays a grid of images with the
ability to view each image in a modal or lightbox.
Implementation:
1. Create React components for the image gallery, individual
images, and the modal/lightbox.
2. Use React state (useState hook) to manage the currently
selected image in the modal.
3. Implement event handlers to open and close the modal and
navigate between images.
4 Style the image gallery and modal using CSS for a visually
appealing presentation.
